Abstract
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The integrated Geospatial Urban Energy Information & Support System
(iGUESS) is currently being developed as part of an EU project to reduce
CO2 emissions in five European cities. The project is intended to create a
decision support platform providing access to distributed data sources and
distributed analysis and modelling tools through a single web-based interface.
The final goal is to furnish the participating cities with current and
projected space-time energy layers for their urban planning process. iGUESS
provides access to tools that compute local renewable energy potentials and
other spatially bound mitigation action potentials, like the construction of
green roofs or installation of renewable energy technologies. These potential
maps are fed into the non-spatial techno-economic assessment model ETEM to find
the best combination of planning actions subject to a set of objectives (e.g.
emission targets) and constraints (e.g. budget), helping urban planers deciding
where, on what technologies and when to invest. The interoperability between
models and data is guaranteed by the usage of the web service standards
specified by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The main iGUESS interface
for decision makers is a web-based GIS, which facilitates the spatial
comparison of different model outputs. The system also provides a component for
impact assessment by comparing the results of different scenarios and making
use of spatial multi-criteria analysis algorithms. Another aspect of iGUESS is
the incorporation of uncertainties associated with input data and modelling
results into the decision support.

Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Rails 3.x, with all the gems specifed in Gemfile
* Python 2.7, with the following libraries:
	* psycopg2
	* mapscript

* GDAL
* MapScript
* MapServer
* Postgres (multiple processes access the database, so sqlite is not advisable)


Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Check out code
* Install web application
* Basic configuration
* Set up cron jobs
* Create password files (harvester_pwd, etc.)


Architecture
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to the web application, there are several Python scripts that play an important role in
the operation of iGUESS.  

*   harvester.py

    The harvester is a script responsible for verifying that information about datasets and processes stored in the data base is up-to-date.  Because of the distributed nature of iGUESS, it is possible that datasets are changed, servers go off-line (and come back online), and the names or descriptions of processes are modified.  

    The harvester systematically visits each of the resources and updates all metadata stored in the system.  If a dataset or process is no longer available, the harvester will mark it as dead in the database, but will not delete it.  "Dead" resources cannot be used by iGUESS, but the harvester will continue to check these "dead" resources, and if one becomes avaialable again, the harvester will mark it as alive and it will be available for use once again.

    The harvester should be scheduled to run periodically via cron.  How often it should be run will depend on the number of resources in the database (more resources mean longer running time, which suggests running the harvester less frequently), and the anticipated liklihood that resources will change over time.

    Note that if a dataset is updated, the new data will be immediately available to modules (as iGUESS only stores pointers to the data), but if metadata changes (including bounding box), those changes will not be reflected in iGUESS until the harvester has been run.  This could potentially cause a problem if datasets are used to denote Areas of Interest for a module.

*   wpsstart.py

    wpsstart.py is responsible for initiating a module run.  When a module is run by clicking the Run button on the web interface, a message is set to the Rails server, which in turn calls wpsstart, passing a list of all the parameters which the WPS server needs to run the module.  The primary task of wpsstart is to assemble these parameters into the format required by WPSClient, which makes the actual call to the WPS server.  Therefore, wpsstart almost entirely consists of rather ugly parameter munging code.

*   wpscheck.py

    When wpscheck is run, it will visit each running module, check its status, and make any necessary updates to the database, including registering any datasets created by the module.  wpscheck should be run from cron, and should be scheduled to run frequently, say once per minute.  The more frequently the process runs, the more responsive the system will feel.

*   deleteDataset.py

    When the user unregisters a dataset, deleteDataset gets called.  deleteDataset's primary job is to ensure that any abandoned datasets on the iGUESS server are deleted.
